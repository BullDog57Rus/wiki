### Architecture vs Microarchitecture
* Architecture:
   * Programmerâ€™s view of computer
   * Defined by instructions and operand locations
* Microarchitecture
   * How to implement an architecture in hardware

## Organization of the computer 
Each computing system consists of the following types of
components:
* Computational devices: one or many CPU cores, DSP, GPU
* Memory hierarchy: caches, memory controllers
* I/O devices, with memory-mapped registers
* Interconnect bus fabric that connects all computational and I/O
devices to the system memory via regular read and write requests
and DMA access from I/O device to the system memory
