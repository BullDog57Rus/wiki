* To command a computer, you must understand its language
   * Instructions: words in a computer’s language
   * Instruction set: the vocabulary of a computer’s language
* Instructions indicate the operation to perform and the operands to
use
   * Assembly language: human-readable format of instructions
   * Machine language: computer-readable format (1’s and 0’s)
   * Because of the close relationship between machine and assembly
   languages, each different machine architecture usually has its own
   assembly language (in fact, each architecture may have several), and
each is unique.
* MIPS architecture
   * Developed by John Hennessy and colleagues at Stanford in the
1980’s
   * Used in many commercial systems (Silicon Graphics, Nintendo,
Cisco)
