#Computer Architecture
>I think it’s fair to say that personal computers have become the most
>empowering tool we’ve ever created. They’re tools of communication,
>they’re tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.
>>Bill Gates, February 24, 2004

The science and the art of **designing**, selecting, and interconnecting
**hardware components** and designing the hardware/software **interface**
to create a computing system that meets function, performance, energy consumption

##Why is architecture important?
* For the world
   * Computer architecture provides the engines that power all of
computing
* For You
   * As computer scientists, software engineers, and sophisticated users,
understanding how computers work is essential
   * The processor is the most important piece of this story
   * Many performance (and efficiency) problems have their roots in
architecture.

##Below your program
* Application software
   * Written in high-level language
* System software
  * Compiler: translates HLL code to machine code
  * Operating System: service code
  * Handling input/output
  * Managing memory and storage
  * Scheduling tasks sharing resources
* Hardware
  * Processor, memory, I/O controllers
