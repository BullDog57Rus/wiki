#Verilog
A high-level computer language can model, represent and simulate digital design
 * Hardware concurrency
 * Parallel activity flow
 * Semantics for signal value and time
 
The main element in the Verilog HDL is module.
Every module describes a specific device or its part.
The name of module is written after the “module” word.
The name of module must be the same as the filename.
